                            <p>Denver Health was founded as City Hospital in 1860 to serve the health care needs of the rapidly developing city of Denver. Since then, we have grown alongside the community to become a complete health care system, proudly providing care for all residents -- at every point in their lives. We believe healthy people are the foundation of a vibrant community, and Denver Health has been treating and healing the people of Denver for more than 160 years.</p>

                            <i><h5>Job Description</h5></i>
                            <p>Walking into Denver Health I was told that this hospital is responsible for taking level 1 trauma events. Being a level 1 trauma center this hospital has to remain open 24/7. I was a central supply technician, I was responsible for maintaining, rotating, and filling all the supplies in the hospital. Since the hospital was operating 24/7 my work consisted of being detail-oriented to ensure that the supply rooms were being filled efficiently. This ensured that the medical staff had the necessary equipment/supplies to keep a smooth flowing operation.</p>

                            <i><h5>Job success</h5></i>
                            <p>While at Denver Health I met a 100% work standard. This standard was built into different sections. The first part of the standard was to make each supply room nice and organized with all of the supply carts accessible every single day. This allowed medical staff to find the supplies required to achieve their goals. The second standard was to make sure each and every single item wasn't expired or damaged to ensure the safety of the patients. The last standard I met was if any medical staff requested a certain item we would deliver the item with urgency knowing that time is crucial. My work ethic and dedication led to me receiving an award. This award was given to me for my leadership and commitment when the company experienced a staff shortage during the peak of Covid-19. </p>

                            <p>My experience at Denver Health was extremely positive. The skills that I have acquired and the connections I have made will surely last a lifetime. Thankful for the recognition I received. I am truly excited to take everything I learned and transfer it to a new career. </p>

                            <p>At Home depot supporting the customer was the number one priority. The customer was always right. This allows us to always satisfy the customer, and improve their experience. I was responsible for taking care of the inventory in the garden section. I learned how to adapt to what people needed to really understand the customer's needs. Another priority that I was responsible for was making sure the store was packed-down and organized so that the customer can find everything they want.</p>
