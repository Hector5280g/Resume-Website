                            <p>As a central supply technician at Denver Health, a level 1 trauma center that operates 24/7, I had the important responsibility of maintaining, rotating, and filling all the supplies in the hospital. It was crucial that I be detail-oriented in order to ensure that the supply rooms were stocked efficiently, so that the medical staff had access to the necessary equipment and supplies at all times. This helped to ensure that the hospital's operations ran smoothly.</p>

                            <p>At Denver Health, I was held to a high standard of work. This standard was divided into several areas. One of my responsibilities was to keep the supply rooms organized and ensure that all supply carts were easily accessible at all times. This allowed medical staff to quickly find the necessary supplies to perform their duties. Another part of the standard was to ensure that all supplies were in good condition and not expired, in order to maintain the safety of patients. In addition, if any medical staff requested a particular item, I would deliver it promptly, recognizing that time is of the essence in a healthcare setting. My dedication to meeting these standards earned me an award for my leadership and commitment, especially during a staff shortage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
