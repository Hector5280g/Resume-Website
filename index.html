                            <p>OpenAI's API allows developers to access the power of their AI models, including DALL-E, through a simple RESTful interface. To create a DALL-E clone using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), you would first need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. Once you have the key, you can use Node.js to make calls to the API and retrieve the generated image or text. You can then store this data in a MongoDB database and use React to display the generated content on the front-end of your application. Express.js can be used to handle the routing and communication between the front-end and the back-end of your application. With this setup, you would be able to create a functional DALL-E clone that can generate images and text based on the user's input. Click Picture for link!</p>

                            <p>I have created an application that utilizes React, a widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and a crypto API. The crypto API allows your application to access real-time data for various cryptocurrencies, including their current market values, trading volumes, and other relevant information. Your application fetches data for all cryptocurrencies and uses this data to display the top cryptos, ranked according to various metrics such as market capitalization. By providing users with up-to-date information on the current state of the cryptocurrency market, your application gives them valuable insights into the trends and fluctuations in the market, enabling them to make informed decisions. The use of a crypto API in your application ensures that the data displayed is dynamic and accurate, making it a valuable tool for anyone interested in the cryptocurrency market.

                            <p>I have created a social media application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), that allows users to create, edit, update, and delete posts. Each post can include a picture, which serves as a visual representation of a memory the user wants to remember. Additionally, the post includes a form where the user can input details about the submission, such as captions, dates, and location. This feature allows users to not only share memories but also provide context and additional information about the memory, making it more meaningful for them and other users. This app is a great way for people to share their memories with friends and family, and keep a digital diary of their life. Click Picture for link!</p>

                            <p>At Denver Health, I was held to a high standard of work. This standard was divided into several areas. One of my responsibilities was to keep the supply rooms organized and ensure that all supply carts were easily accessible at all times. This allowed medical staff to quickly find the necessary supplies to perform their duties. Another part of the standard was to ensure that all supplies were in good condition and not expired, in order to maintain the safety of patients. In addition, if any medical staff requested a particular item, I would deliver it promptly, recognizing that time is of the essence in a healthcare setting. My dedication to meeting these standards earned me an award for my leadership and commitment, especially during a staff shortage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
